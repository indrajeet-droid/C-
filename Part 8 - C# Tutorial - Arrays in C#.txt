1. Array is a collection of similar data type
2. Advantage: strongly type it will store only same type of data
3. Disadvantages:- fixed in size once it initialized. Have to rely on index for      retrival and store

 int[] EvenNumbers = new int[3];
        EvenNumbers[0] = 0;
        EvenNumbers[1] = 2;
        EvenNumbers[2] = 4;

  // Retrieve and print even numbers from the array
        for (int i = 0; i < EvenNumbers.Length; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(EvenNumbers[i]);
        }
